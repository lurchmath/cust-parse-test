# Prove this project is viable

Can it handle Lurch notation?
 - Use the scraper tool in the lurchmath repo's grading tools folder to get a
   list of all unique Lurch notation expressions used in Math299 in Spring 2024.
 - Use the new JSON API described above to define a new language of Lurch
   notation and verify that all (or almost all) of the expressions scraped from
   Math299 can be parsed correctly by the converter defined in that way.

# Polish the project's features

Make it easier for language designers to use whatever spacing they want.
 - Right now the spacing in the LaTeX notation in the example converter is
   inconsistent.  Some things are like `x ^ { - 1 }`, to permit whatever spacing
   the user wants, and some things are like `[x,y]`, which do not.  Two fixes:
    - First, be consistent and allow flexible user spacing everywhere.
    - Second, can we write two notations, a top-priority one `x^{-1}` and a
      lower-priority one `x ^ { - 1 }`, so that the latter gives flexibility and
      the former is the default one used for output?
   This may relate to the need to define the LaTeX notation for EFAs as
   `\\mathcal{A} (B)` (space important!) because if we do not, then the token
   `}(` is created, and prioritized more highly than `{`, which makes it
   impossible to then parse `f^{-1}(x)`.  Creating the lower-priority parsing of
   `x^{-1}` might allow LaTeX notation authors to write `\\mathcal{A}(B)`, but
   I have not yet tested it.
 - If this works, add support for a new option in the final argument to
   `addNotation()` that shows where spaces are permitted in the notation, as in
   `addNotation( 'inverse', 'f^{-1}', { spaces:'f ^ { - 1 }' } )`.  In that
   case, the system will add both notations for you, in the correct priority
   order, so that the desired behavior happens automatically.

# MathLive symbols and/or notation we don't currently support:

```
\pm as in v\pm w
\imaginaryI
\sqrt (including both \sqrt{...} and things like \sqrt5)
\exp which is just a math-Roman operator, I think
\exponentialE
\therefore
\cong (because we use \equiv for equivalence mod a number)
\lim
\sum (which is used in Math299 but I haven't added it here yet)
\differentialD and \int/\iint/\iiint
\nexists
\ni (horizontally flipped version of \in, and the negated version of it
   in MathLive is \not\owns)

\differentialD x
dQ // unexpected!  should be \differentialD Q?
\frac{d}{dx}                    \frac{d}{\differentialD x}
                                // Also lets you type just the d by itself: \mathrm{d}
                                // Also supports \partial
\int x^2 \cdot dx               \int x^2\cdot\differentialD x
                                // or if we write it the usual way:
                                \int x^2dx // !! (bug to report to MathLive?)
\int (\frac x k - 10)\cdot dk   \int\left(\frac{x}{k}-10\right)\cdot dk
                                \int\left(\frac{x}{k}-10\right)dk // or this
\int_0^2 (s+t)\cdot dt          \int_0^2\!\left(s+t\right)\,\mathrm{dt} // !!
                                // Note: the above happens by use of the keyboard template
                                // But if you delete and retype the dt, you get:
                                \int_0^2\!\left(s+t\right)\,dt // Bug to report
\int^b_a |x-1|\cdot dx          \int_{a}^{b}\left\vert x-1\right\vert\differentialD x\!
                                // Note I edited an earlier integral,
                                // which moved the space to the end, unseen!

\overrightarrow{...}, \overleftarrow{...}, \overline{...}, \underline{...}
X^{\prime}, X^{\doubleprime}

page, which will also let you update your Lurch docs in the lurchmath.github.io repo.)
