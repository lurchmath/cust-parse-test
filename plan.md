# Prove this project is viable

Can it handle Lurch notation?
 - Use the scraper tool in the lurchmath repo's grading tools folder to get a
   list of all unique Lurch notation expressions used in Math299 in Spring 2024.
 - Use the new JSON API described above to define a new language of Lurch
   notation and verify that all (or almost all) of the expressions scraped from
   Math299 can be parsed correctly by the converter defined in that way.

# Polish the project's features

Support left- and right-associativity for operators (which is kind of the
opposite of associative flattening, which you already support).
 - Add the capability of asking for all possible parsings, rather than just
   getting the first one.
    - Run tests on this, especially anywhere the test suite mentioned
      "alphabetical order."
    - Rewrite one-result parsing functions so that they call this one and then
      index/filter the result.
    - Did not bother adding "arcsin" and "asin" and so on for all trig functions
      because doing so does not add any functionality and just clutters things
      up, given that we already have `^{-1}` notation for all functions.
      Could be done if needed.
 - Add a feature where you can specify, for any given operator, whether it
   associates right or left, and if you do, then we will filter out of the list
   of valid parsings any result that contains a nesting different than what you
   specified.  (Suggestion: Use the option with key "associates" instead of the
   key "associative," because these operators are explicitly NOT associative.)

Make it easier for language designers to use whatever spacing they want.
 - Right now the spacing in the LaTeX notation in the example converter is
   inconsistent.  Some things are like `x ^ { - 1 }`, to permit whatever spacing
   the user wants, and some things are like `[x,y]`, which do not.  Two fixes:
    - First, be consistent and allow flexible user spacing everywhere.
    - Second, can we write two notations, a top-priority one `x^{-1}` and a
      lower-priority one `x ^ { - 1 }`, so that the latter gives flexibility and
      the former is the default one used for output?
   This may relate to the need to define the LaTeX notation for EFAs as
   `\\mathcal{A} (B)` (space important!) because if we do not, then the token
   `}(` is created, and prioritized more highly than `{`, which makes it
   impossible to then parse `f^{-1}(x)`.  Creating the lower-priority parsing of
   `x^{-1}` might allow LaTeX notation authors to write `\\mathcal{A}(B)`, but
   I have not yet tested it.
 - If this works, add support for a new option in the final argument to
   `addNotation()` that shows where spaces are permitted in the notation, as in
   `addNotation( 'inverse', 'f^{-1}', { spaces:'f ^ { - 1 }' } )`.  In that
   case, the system will add both notations for you, in the correct priority
   order, so that the desired behavior happens automatically.

# Document things

Overview documentation with assumptions, like these:
 - whitespace is not meaningful
 - alphabetically least JSON parsing leads to right association in most cases
   (which is good for conditional, f.ex., and irrelevant for associative stuff)
 - when you say how to write a variable, that's how it will be written in ANY
   language

The procedure for adding new concepts and tests to the example converter:
 1. Add a new `addConcept()` call to the `example-converter.js` file, with
    the appropriate putdown notation included.
 2. Add an `it()` call to `test-parsing-putdown.js` to ensure that the new
    concept can be parsed from putdown notation.
     - Possibly also add a test to an `it()` whose purpose is to test nesting
       of expressions in one another, using the new type you just introduced.
 3. Add an `it()` call to `test-creating-putdown.js` to ensure that the new
    concept can be rendered to putdown notation.  (You can probably copy and
    paste the test you created in item 2., but rename the function call and
    swap the two arguments' order.)
     - Possibly also add a test to an `it()` whose purpose is to test nesting
       of expressions in one another, using the new type you just introduced.
 4. Add a new `addNotation()` call to the `example-converter.js` file, with
    one or more LaTeX notations for the new concept.
 5. Add an `it()` call to `test-parsing-latex.js` to ensure that the new
    concept can be parsed from latex notation.
     - Possibly also add a test to an `it()` whose purpose is to test
       precedence of your new operator (if indeed it is one) compared to
       pre-existing ones.
 6. Add an `it()` call to `test-creating-latex.js` to ensure that the new
    concept can be rendered to latex notation.  (You can probably copy and
    paste the test you created in item 5., but rename the function call and
    swap the two arguments' order.)
     - Possibly also add a test to an `it()` whose purpose is to test that
       rendering puts groupers where needed to respect relative precedence.
 7. Add an `it()` call to `test-putdown-to-latex.js` to compose two of the
    tests run above.
 8. Add an `it()` call to `test-latex-to-putdown.js` to compose two of the
    tests run above.

Limitations of the current version
 - Common mathematical concepts we do not currently have in our default set
    - Intervals `(1,2)`, `[1,2]`, `[1,2)`, `(1,2]`
    - Absolute values, using `|...|` or `\vert...\vert` (opt.w/`\left/\right`)
    - Norms/distances, using `||...||` or `\Vert...\Vert` (opt.w/`\left/\right`)
    - All upper and lower case Greek letters, with variants
 - The fact that our LaTeX parser currently can't handle `\frac12` and similar
   things because of tokenization of 12 as twelve.  Note that this does not play
   nicely with MathLive at present.
 - The fact that there are some symbols that you can enter with the MathLive
   keyboard (in its default configuration) that we don't support (listed below)

```
\pm as in v\pm w
\imaginaryI
\sqrt (including both \sqrt{...} and things like \sqrt5)
\exp which is just a math-Roman operator, I think
\exponentialE
\therefore
\cong (because we use \equiv for equivalence mod a number)
\lim
\sum (which is used in Math299 but I haven't added it here yet)
\differentialD and \int/\iint/\iiint
\nexists
\ni (horizontally flipped version of \in, and the negated version of it
   in MathLive is \not\owns)

\differentialD x
dQ // unexpected!  should be \differentialD Q?
\frac{d}{dx}                    \frac{d}{\differentialD x}
                                // Also lets you type just the d by itself: \mathrm{d}
                                // Also supports \partial
\int x^2 \cdot dx               \int x^2\cdot\differentialD x
                                // or if we write it the usual way:
                                \int x^2dx // !! (bug to report to MathLive?)
\int (\frac x k - 10)\cdot dk   \int\left(\frac{x}{k}-10\right)\cdot dk
                                \int\left(\frac{x}{k}-10\right)dk // or this
\int_0^2 (s+t)\cdot dt          \int_0^2\!\left(s+t\right)\,\mathrm{dt} // !!
                                // Note: the above happens by use of the keyboard template
                                // But if you delete and retype the dt, you get:
                                \int_0^2\!\left(s+t\right)\,dt // Bug to report
\int^b_a |x-1|\cdot dx          \int_{a}^{b}\left\vert x-1\right\vert\differentialD x\!
                                // Note I edited an earlier integral,
                                // which moved the space to the end, unseen!

\overrightarrow{...}, \overleftarrow{...}, \overline{...}, \underline{...}
X^{\prime}, X^{\doubleprime}
{\displaylines x\\ y} is like a fraction with no bar
